# LUKi Project - Next Phase Roadmap

## Current Status
- ✅ luki-memory-service: Core data ingestion, storage, and management components implemented
- ✅ luki-api-gateway: Basic HTTP interface and routing structure established

## Phase 1 MVP Objectives Completed
- Standalone, text-only AI companion
- ELR data ingestion pipeline
- Vector embeddings storage in ChromaDB
- Basic API gateway with routing and middleware

## Next Phase Objectives

### 1. API Gateway Enhancements
- Implement full integration with luki-memory-service via HTTP calls
- Add comprehensive error handling and response formatting
- Implement proper authentication and authorization flows
- Add rate limiting with Redis backend
- Implement request logging and tracing

### 2. Core Agent Development (luki-core-agent)
- Implement context builder with ELR retrieval layer
- Develop LangChain agent core with LLaMA 3-70B integration
- Create prompt engineering framework for personality system
- Implement session management for conversation state
- Add access control and consent checking mechanisms

### 3. Memory Service Integration
- Connect API gateway to memory service endpoints
- Implement proper data serialization between services
- Add health checks and service discovery patterns

### 4. Testing and QA
- Add unit tests for all API endpoints
- Implement integration tests between services
- Conduct manual testing with realistic user profiles
- Verify GDPR compliance and data protection measures

### 5. Deployment Preparation
- Create Docker configurations for all services
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
- Prepare cloud deployment scripts (AWS/GPU)
- Implement monitoring and observability features

## Timeline Estimates
- API Gateway Enhancements: 3-5 days
- Core Agent Development: 1-2 weeks
- Integration Testing: 2-3 days
- Deployment Preparation: 3-4 days

## Key Dependencies
- luki-memory-service must be running for integration testing
- Redis server for rate limiting (can be mocked for initial development)
- LLaMA 3-70B model access for core agent
